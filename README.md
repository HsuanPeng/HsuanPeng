## Who I am
Hi, I‚Äôm a front-end developer with a solid background in React and Vue, and a strong passion for creating intuitive and engaging user experiences. I pay close attention to UI/UX details and enjoy building interfaces that not only look great but also feel smooth and user-friendly.

Currently, I work at KGI Securities, where I focus on developing and maintaining front-end applications. I‚Äôm fluent in both English and Mandarin, which allows me to collaborate effectively with international teams and ensure clear communication and timely delivery. I also assist with UI/UX design refinements when needed to help bridge the gap between design and development.

Previously, I was a front-end developer at a startup, where I worked in an agile team using Scrum. That experience trained me to adapt quickly, pick up new technologies on the fly, and deliver high-quality features in fast-paced environments.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, reading, and cooking‚Äîactivities that keep me balanced and inspired.
