## Who I am
Hi! I‚Äôm a front-end developer with hands-on building smooth, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.

I‚Äôm fluent in both English and Mandarin, making communication easy and efficient across international teams.

Currently working at KGI Securities, I‚Äôve handled enterprise-level front-end projects, collaborated with cross-functional teams, and consistently delivered high-quality results on time.

I also support UI/UX improvements when needed.

Previously, I worked in a fast-paced startup environment using Scrum, where I quickly learned to adapt, research new technologies, and apply them effectively.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, reading, and cooking‚Äîactivities that keep me balanced and inspired.
